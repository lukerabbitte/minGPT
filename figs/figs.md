- 5.
- 6 achieves low loss quite well. Try its setup on bigger set?
- 7 shows too high a learning rate.
- 8 shows sensitivity even to a small amount more loss.
- 9 through 11 show buildup of same training run.
- 12 compares to 6 but has context length of 10. Worse.
- 13 is literally 12 but with context length back up to 30. (Wait, this is now same as 5).
- 14 uses more extreme dataset, but crucially has good performance compared to 6, which is on a tiny dataset.
